This repository holds some of the SQL exercises I've done in Colt Steele's Udemy bootcamp on learning MySQL.

- Worked with a Instagram database clone of hundreds of users and wrote queries that answered real-world questions.

- Built a web app using Node.js, Express, MySQL where users can input their email to join a fake group. The number of users in the db is reflected on the web app after users submit their email.

- Learned a lot about web frameworks like Express, HTTP methods, and how applications communicate with relational databases like MySQL.
